# Have challenge goals tie back to research questions (how are we gonna implement
# machine learning model and data visualizations)

# machine learning: look at major features that affect our model, 
# how to get best performance (depth of trees)

# testing our code: use assert_equals 
    # break down our data into helper functions
    # create smaller dataset and test expected output against this

# DATA VIS WE CAN CREATE:
#  Which occupations result in the largest pay gap between men and women?

# How do attributes other than gender (such as ethnicity, socio-economic 
# status, immigration status) contribute to the pay gap? Which attributes 
# result in the largest disparity?

# What was the change over time for pay for men vs. women?
